An interpretation of [Primal (MeringuePersonnal)](https://www.reddit.com/user/MeringuePersonal3407/) theme found on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1ix9124/my_collection/).<br />

Most of the background assets comes from [emuemovies](https://emumovies.com/) thanks to them.<br />

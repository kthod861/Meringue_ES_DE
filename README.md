# Meringue ES DE theme

An interpretation of [Primal (MeringuePersonnal)](https://www.reddit.com/user/MeringuePersonal3407/) theme found on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1ix9124/my_collection/).<br />

Compatible with [ES-DE 3.2.0](https://es-de.org/).<br>
Support 4:3, 1:1, 3:2, 16:9 aspect ratios with simple game grid.<br />
Gamelist tiles sizes can be changed using the theme font size <br />


TODO: <br />
Based on discussions with Leon
- New repo ( so the theme can be added to the official theme list...aka no history )
- Correct naming convention (meringue-es-ed for the repo)
- Investigate what are badges ?
- Ports vs Portmaster mistake ( you'r not in Knulli anymore ! )
- Lets support 19.5:9 / 16:10
- Actual use of font sizes ( on top of the gamelist grid management )

DONE: <br />
- Metadata / logos, some controllers and some backgrounds now comes from the official es-de assets repo
- No more various texts 
- Theme name naming convention
- Xbox one / Mark III / N3ds systems added
- Full code revamp and switch to brushed style
- Newly added (3.2.0) clock and system status support
- Optimisations from 255 Mo to 157 Mo
- Infos added
- Gamelist grid added
- missing background added
- 16:9 background added
- 1:1 foregraound patched
- System infos and controler tweaks in all ratios
- Ratio management system should be ok now and handle all situations




If by any chance you've a system folder with enough good looking boxarts and are willing to share, please ping me !<br />
At the moment almost everything comes from [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)

All tiled backgrounds images are generated using [those tools](https://github.com/kthod861/Boxart_Project)


Big up to "Meringue", "Ant", "SymBuzzer", "Shadow" and more for the help they've provided here and there .<br>

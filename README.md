# Meringue ES DE RG406 theme

An interpretation of [Primal (MeringuePersonnal)](https://www.reddit.com/user/MeringuePersonal3407/) theme found on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1ix9124/my_collection/).<br />

Compatible with [ES-DE 3.1.1](https://es-de.org/).<br>
Support 4:3, 1:1, 16:9 aspect ratios with simple game grid.<br />
Gamelist tiles sizes can be changed using the theme font size <br />

If by any chance you've a system folder with enough good looking boxarts and are willing to share, please ping me !<br />
At the moment almost everything comes from [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)

All tiled backgrounds images are generated using [those tools](https://github.com/kthod861/Boxart_Project)


TODO: <br />

- Try a Lottie basic animation to make logos appear in a better way ( probably a wrong idea )

DONE: <br />
- Ratio management system should be ok now and handle all situations
- System infos and controler tweaks in all ratios
- 1:1 foregraound patched
- 16:9 background added
- missing background added
- Gamelist grid added
- Infos added
- Optimisations from 255 Mo to 157 Mo

Big up to "Meringue", "Ant", "SymBuzzer", "Shadow" and more for the help they've provided here and there .

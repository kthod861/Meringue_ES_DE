# (NOT WORKING YET) Meringue ES DE RG406 theme

An interpretation of [Primal (MeringuePersonnal)](https://www.reddit.com/user/MeringuePersonal3407/) theme found on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1ix9124/my_collection/).<br />

Support 4:3,1:1,16:9 aspect ratios with simple game grid.<br />

If by any chance you've a system folder with enough good looking boxarts and are willing to share, please ping me !<br />
At the moment almost everything comes from [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)

TODO: <br />

- GameList implementation
- Try a Lottie basic animation to make logos appear in a better way ( probably a wrong idea )
- Recreate all backgrounds with a better resolution, they are dirty atm

DONE: <br />
- Ratio management system should be ok now and handle all situations
- System infos and controler tweaks in all ratio
- 1:1 foregraound patched
  

Big up to "Meringue", "Ant", "SymBuzzer", "Shadow" and more for the help they've provided here and there .
